Simple tests with pregenerated KGraphs are located in layeropt_tests. These tests only test verification of execution. 

To run tests do:
    make sanity

To see a list of tests do:
    make help

To run one test from “make help” list, do:
    make <test name>
 
There are some tests that are big and need to be generated using TFFE, like resnet50_act4_to_act7, so do the following:
    make gen_test
 
Files and directories:
 
    me_main.py:
        main for ME version 2 (formerly part of layeropt2.py); this has the batching outter loop
    me_batch.py:
        contain batching parameters, including data region map
    me_graph.py:
        graph/node classes to hold KGraph (and Wavegraph after read-back)
    me_fused_op.py:
        fused operation execution; this is where the inner loops are (after batching outter loop)
    me_utils.py:
        utilities to manage numpy shapes and files
    me_models.py:
        contains models of the major engines
    layeropt.py:
        older version of ME, still usable for some tests and for LSTM network
    tests:
        ME tests having either KGraph for simple tests, or TF Protobuf graph for bigger tests (use “make gen_test” to generate the files using TFFE)
