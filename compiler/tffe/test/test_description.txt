add           Two layer, BiasAdd followed by ResAdd

biasadd       Single BiasAdd layer

0-1mp         Single MaxPoll layer
0-1ap         Single AvgPoll layer

1conv         Single Conv2D layer
1conv         Two Conv2D layers back to back

padasym       Single Conv2D layer with asymmetric padding
padsym        Single Conv2D layer with symmetric padding

conv_pad      Single Conv2D layer that exercises padding

^[4-9]-       Full size networks
^[4-9]-.*wave       Full size networks using wave scheduler


^0-1conv0      Existence tests for 1 conv2D layer with 1x1 filter and 1x1 image. It multiplies 2 * 3 = 6.
^0-1conv0_wave Existence test for wave scheduler
0-1conv_tile  Single Conv2D layer with a large image
0-10conv_relu Resnet-like network with 10 Conv2D and Relu layer pairs
^0-116conv_tanh  Resnet-like network with 116 Conv2D and Relu layer pairs
