* Description
wave-checker is designed to examine compliance of a wave graph with instruction set architecture (ISA) and execution model of Tonga. It currently supports checks listed below.
- Detection of structural defects
   o Non-DRAM wave ops such as MatMul, Activation, ResAdd and Pool should have
   both incoming and outgoing edges.
   o An wave op should not have duplicated edges.
- Detection of potential data race between wave ops
   o It detects potential WAW/RAW/WAR hazards between indepdent wave ops

* Build
Run $KAENA_PATH/compiler/wave-checker/build.csh
It will create wc-build directory and build wave-checker inside it.

* Usage
bin/wave-checker [Options]
   --help, -h : Help
   --wave-graph-file, -w : Specifies wave graph file name and location
   --structure-check : Enable structure check
   --data-race-check : Enable data race check
In the build directory, 
run 'bin/wave-checker --wave-graph-file "YOUR_WAVE_GRAPH" [--structure-check] [--data-race-check]
run 'test/wc_gtest' to run regression test
