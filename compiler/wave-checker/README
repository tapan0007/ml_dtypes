* Description
wave-checker is designed to examine compliance of a wave graph with instruction set architecture (ISA) and execution model of Tonga. It currently supports checks listed below.
- Detection of structural defects
   o Non-DRAM wave ops such as MatMul, Activation, ResAdd and Pool should have
   both incoming and outgoing edges.
   o An wave op should not have duplicated edges.
- Detection of potential data race between wave ops
   o It detects potential WAW/RAW/WAR hazards between indepdent wave ops

* Build
1. export GTEST_DIR=YOUR-GOOGLETEST-LOCATION
2. Create build directory and move to the directory (e.g. mkdir wc-build;cd wc-build)
3. Run 'cmake ${KAENA_PATH}/compiler/wave-checker'
4. Run 'make'

* Usage
In the build directory, 
run 'src/wave-checker wave_graph.json'
run 'test/wc_gtest' to run regression test
